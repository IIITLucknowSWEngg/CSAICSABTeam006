**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**:  
InDrive is a ride-hailing app that provides a unique peer-to-peer transportation service where passengers and drivers can negotiate ride prices directly. Unlike other platforms that rely on fixed fare algorithms, InDrive allows passengers to suggest a price, and drivers have the option to accept, reject, or counter the offer. This empowers both parties to agree on a fair price, making it a cost-effective alternative for users in diverse markets.

The app offers a user-friendly interface for booking rides, tracking drivers in real-time, and reviewing completed trips. Passengers can select from various vehicle types based on their preferences and requirements. InDrive also promotes transparency and safety by allowing users to rate drivers, providing in-app SOS features, and enabling driver background checks. The service is popular in regions with fluctuating fare demands and is expanding rapidly across different cities worldwide, offering both affordability and flexibility to riders.
