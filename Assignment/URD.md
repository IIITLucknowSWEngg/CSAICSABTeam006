# InDrive Clone - User Requirements Documentation (URD)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the user requirements for the development of an InDrive clone, a ride-hailing mobile application. The system allows users to request rides and drivers to offer their services in a location-based setting. Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, this app will allow passengers and drivers to negotiate fare prices.

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the requirements of the ride-hailing application. This includes the appâ€™s core functionalities, target audience, user interactions, and system constraints.

### 1.2 Scope

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the InDrive clone. It is intended for developers, testers, and project stakeholders to ensure the system meets user expectations.

## 8 Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

To ensure efficient and high-quality development and deployment of the InDrive clone application, a CI/CD pipeline will be implemented. This section outlines the CI/CD requirements.

---

### 8.1 Continuous Integration (CI)

CI focuses on automating code integration, testing, and validation. Key CI requirements include:

1. *Version Control Integration*
   - Use a Git-based repository system like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for source code management.
   - Enforce branching and merging policies to maintain code stability.

2. *Automated Build*
   - Configure tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or GitHub Actions to automatically build the application whenever code is committed or merged into the main branch.
   - Ensure builds for both Android and iOS platforms are generated.

3. *Automated Testing*
   - Implement unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests to validate new features or updates.
   - Use frameworks like Jest, Mocha, or JUnit for backend testing and Appium or Espresso for mobile app testing.
   - Automatically run tests as part of the CI pipeline.

4. *Code Quality and Security Analysis*
   - Integrate tools like SonarQube for static code analysis to maintain code quality.
   - Use security scanners to identify vulnerabilities in code dependencies.

5. *Notification and Feedback*
   - Notify the development team via Slack, email, or other channels about build and test results.

---

### 8.2 Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD automates the release process, ensuring smooth updates to production with minimal downtime. Key CD requirements include:

1. *Staging Environment*
   - Set up a staging environment to test features in a production-like setting.
   - Allow manual approval before deploying to production.

2. *Automated Deployment*
   - Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or AWS CodePipeline to automate deployment to servers or app stores.
   - Implement zero-downtime deployment strategies using techniques like blue-green or canary deployment.

3. *Versioning and Rollback*
   - Maintain a versioning system for each release to track changes.
   - Enable rollback to the previous stable version in case of deployment issues.

4. *Monitoring and Logging*
   - Integrate tools like ELK Stack, New Relic, or Datadog for application performance monitoring.
   - Monitor deployment logs and handle exceptions or errors.

5. *App Store Deployment*
   - Automate submission of app updates to the Google Play Store and Apple App Store using tools like Fastlane.
