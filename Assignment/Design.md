## **1. High-Level Architecture**
### **A. Architecture Type**
- **Client-Server Model**: Use a client-server architecture where the frontend communicates with the backend via APIs.
- **Microservices Architecture**: For scalability, modularity, and ease of deployment, divide the backend into microservices.
- **Cloud-Native**: Host services on the cloud for better scalability and cost-effectiveness.

### **B. Key Components**
1. **Frontend (Client-side)**
   - User interface for web and mobile applications.
   - Interaction with APIs for file operations and user actions.

2. **Backend (Server-side)**
   - API Gateway: Centralized entry point for client requests.
   - Service Layer: Individual services for user management, file storage, search, notifications, etc.
   - Business Logic: Core logic for authentication, access control, and collaboration.

3. **Database**
   - Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL): Store user metadata, file metadata, and permissions.
   - NoSQL Database (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB): Store activity logs or files metadata for quick access.
   - Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage): Store actual files.

4. **Security Layer**
   - Authentication Service: OAuth2/JWT for secure authentication.
   - Encryption Service: Encrypt files at rest and in transit.

5. **Monitoring and Analytics**
   - Collect logs, monitor system health, and provide insights on usage.

## **2. Logical Design**
### **A. Modules**
1. **Authentication Module**
   - User login, registration, and password management.
   - Integration with OAuth2 and MFA for enhanced security.

2. **File Management Module**
   - CRUD operations for files and folders.
   - File versioning and metadata management.
   - File upload/download with resumable upload support.

3. **Sharing and Collaboration Module**
   - Link-based sharing with permissions (view, edit, comment).
   - Real-time collaboration (e.g., shared documents).

4. **Search Module**
   - Full-text search for file names and content.
   - Advanced filtering by metadata.

5. **Notifications Module**
   - Email and push notifications for activity updates.

6. **Analytics Module**
   - Dashboard for storage usage and user activity.

---

### **B. Data Flow**
1. **File Upload**
   - User uploads a file → Frontend sends request to the API Gateway → Storage Service saves the file in cloud storage → File metadata is saved in the database.
   
2. **File Sharing**
   - User creates a sharing link → API generates a link token → Permission and metadata saved in the database.

3. **Search**
   - User searches → Frontend sends query to Search Service → Service queries database and returns results.

---

## **3. Database Design**
### **A. Relational Database Schema**
1. **Users Table**
   - `user_id`: Primary Key
   - `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `profile_picture`

2. **Files Table**
   - `file_id`: Primary Key
   - `user_id`: Foreign Key (owner)
   - `file_name`, `file_size`, `file_path`, `created_at`, `updated_at`

3. **Folders Table**
   - `folder_id`: Primary Key
   - `user_id`: Foreign Key
   - `folder_name`, `parent_folder_id`

4. **Sharing Table**
   - `share_id`: Primary Key
   - `file_id`: Foreign Key
   - `shared_with`: User or public link
   - `permissions`: Enum (view, edit)

---

### **B. NoSQL Schema**
- **Activity Logs**
  - Document structure: `{ user_id, action, file_id, timestamp }`

---

## **4. Component Design**
### **A. Frontend**
- Framework: React.js (Web), React Native/Flutter (Mobile)
- State Management: Redux or Context API for user state and file metadata.
- UI Components:
  - File Explorer
  - Drag-and-Drop Upload
  - Collaboration Workspace
- API Communication: Axios or Fetch API for RESTful API calls.

---

### **B. Backend**
- **API Gateway**
  - Routes requests to appropriate microservices.
  - Handles rate limiting and load balancing.

- **Microservices**
  - User Service: Handles authentication, registration, and user management.
  - Storage Service: Manages file uploads/downloads and metadata.
  - Search Service: Implements search indexing and querying.
  - Notification Service: Sends activity alerts and updates.

- **Communication**
  - REST APIs: For client-to-server communication.
  - Message Queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka): For inter-service communication and asynchronous tasks like notifications.

---

## **5. Security Design**
- **Authentication**
  - OAuth2 for third-party login (e.g., Google, Facebook).
  - JWT for session management.
  
- **Access Control**
  - Role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC/ABAC).
  
- **Data Protection**
  - Encryption: Use AES-256 for files and TLS for data in transit.

- **Audit Logs**
  - Maintain logs for all user actions for compliance and debugging.

---

## **6. Deployment Design**
- **Cloud Provider**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Use Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI/CD.
- **Load Balancing**: Use AWS Elastic Load Balancer or NGINX.
- **Containerization**: Use Docker and Kubernetes for service deployment.

---

## **7. Development Workflow**
1. **Requirements Gathering**: Collaborate with stakeholders to finalize requirements.
2. **Agile Development**: Use Scrum or Kanban for iterative development.
3. **Testing**
   - Unit Tests: Jest (Frontend), PyTest/JUnit (Backend).
   - Integration Tests: Postman/Newman or Cypress.
4. **Version Control**: Use Git with branching strategies like GitFlow.
